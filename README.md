# Project Name

**Author**: Eva Grace Smith
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This is based off of a previous project I worked on called [Horned Beast](https://earnest-sunburst-144714.netlify.app) that I am redoing using JSX, Vite and Pico.
I wanted to refactor from React class-based components to the more modern function-based components, and this was a great opportunity for a fun side by side comparison.
